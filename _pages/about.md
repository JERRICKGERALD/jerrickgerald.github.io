Hello People,

I am a Master's Data Science graduate from The George Washington University, where I was supervised by Professor Edwin Lo. Currently, I am working as a Data Engineer at Marlabs LLC and planning to pursue a PhD in Computer Science starting in Spring 2025. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University.

My research interests include imbalanced datasets, large language models, machine learning, and data science. I am dedicated to leveraging data-driven approaches to address real-world challenges and improve decision-making processes.
